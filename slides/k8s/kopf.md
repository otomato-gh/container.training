# KOPF

- Writing a quick and dirty operator is (relatively) easy

- Doing it right, however ...

--

- We need:

  - proper CRD with schema validation

  - controller performing a reconcilation loop

  - manage errors, retries, dependencies between resources

  - maybe webhooks for admission and/or conversion

ðŸ˜±

## Frameworks

- There are a few frameworks available out there:

  - [kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder)
    ([book](https://book.kubebuilder.io/)):
    go-centric, very close to Kubernetes' core types

  - [operator-framework](https://operatorframework.io/):
    higher level; also supports Ansible and Helm

  - [KUDO](https://kudo.dev/):
    declarative operators written in YAML

  - [KOPF](https://kopf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):
    operators in Python

  - ...

---

## KOPF Intro

- Kopf is a framework for building Kubernetes operators in Python.

- Unlike other frameworks KOPF doesn't take care of scaffolding the Kubernetes resource definitions

- It also gives us tools to quickly run the controller against a cluster

  (not necessarily *on* the cluster)

---

## Our objective

- We're going to implement a *useless machine*

  [basic example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqAUmgE3WyM)

  [playful example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kproPsch7i0)
  |
  [advanced example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nqk_nWAjBus)
  |
  [another advanced example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLtUB8ncEnA)

- A machine manifest will look like this:
  ```yaml
    kind: Machine
    apiVersion: useless.container.training/v1alpha1
    metadata:
      name: machine-1
    spec:
      # Our useless operator will change that to "down"
      switchPosition: up
  ```

- Each time we change the `switchPosition`, the operator will move it back to `down`

(This is inspired by the
[uselessoperator](https://github.com/tilt-dev/uselessoperator)
written by 
[L KÃ¶rbes](https://twitter.com/ellenkorbes).
Highly recommend!ðŸ’¯)

## Python 3 environment setup

- Python 3.7+ is needed for this tutorial

- It will typically be installed on your lab machine

- In general we recommend using `virtualenv` to manage Python installations

- If Python is not installed and you're running on Ubuntu/Debian - install it with `apt-get update && apt-get install python3 python3-pip`

- For other platforms: [How to Install Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
---


## Preparation

- Install pre-requirements

  (on our VMs: `pip3 install kopf kubernetes`)


---

## Create the CRD

- The CRD for our `Machines` are already available 

.exercise[

- Create the CRD:
  ```bash
kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/kopf-crd.yaml
  ```

- Examine it:
  ```bash
kubectl get crd machines.useless.container.training -oyaml
  ```
]

---

## Creating a machine

Look at `~/container.training/k8s/kopf-machine.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: Machine
apiVersion: useless.container.training/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: machine-1
spec:
  # Our useless operator will change that to "down"
  switchPosition: up
```

We'll apply it to the cluster shortly.

---

## Designing the controller

- Our controller needs to:

  - notice when a `switchPosition` is not `down`

  - move it to `down` when that happens

- Later, we can add fancy improvements (wait a bit before moving it, etc.)

---

## Notice when an object is created

- Our *reconciler* will be called when necessary

- When necessary = when a resource is

  - created

  - updated

  - deleted

- Let's see how to react on object creation
---

## Notice when an object is created

.exercise[
  Create a file my_operator.py:
```python
import kopf

@kopf.on.create('machines.useless.container.training')
def create_fn(body, **kwargs):
    print(f"A handler is called with body: {body}")
```

]

---

## Running the controller

Our controller is not ready yet, but let's try what we have right now!

This will run the controller locally:
```
kopf run my_operator.py
```

Then:

- create a machine
- change the `switchPosition`
- delete the machine

---

## Check what operator does

.exercise[
  Create a file my_operator.py:
```bash
kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/kopf-machine.yaml

kubectl patch machine machine-1 --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"switchPosition": "down"}}'

kubectl delete -f ~/container.training/k8s/kopf-machine.yaml

```

]

---

## Updating an object

The controller notices when an object is created...

Now let's implement the machine functionality

```python
def create_fn(spec, name, namespace, logger, **kwargs):
    switch_pos = spec.get('switchPosition')
    if not switch_pos == 'down':
        machine_patch = {'spec': {'switchPosition': 'down'}}
    crds = kubernetes.client.CustomObjectsApi()
    obj =  crds.patch_namespaced_custom_object("useless.container.training",
                                        "v1alpha1",
                                        namespace,
                                        "machines",
                                        name=name,
                                        body=machine_patch)
```

## Spec vs Status

- Spec = desired state

- Status = observed state

- If Status is lost, the controller should be able to reconstruct it

  (maybe with degraded behavior in the meantime)

- Status will almost always be a sub-resource

  (so that it can be updated separately "cheaply")

---

class: extra-details

## Spec vs Status (in depth)

- The `/status` subresource is handled differently by the API server

- Updates to `/status` don't alter the rest of the object

- Conversely, updates to the object ignore changes in the status

(See [the docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#status-subresource) for the fine print.)

---

## Updating the machine 

- Let's flip the switch on one of our machines manually

.exercise[
```
kubectl patch machine machine-1 --type=merge -p "
spec:
  SwitchPosition: up
"
```
Does it get flipped back down?
```
kubectl get machine machine-1 -ojsonpath="{ .spec.SwitchPosition }"
```
Not really...
]

- Our controller only flips the switch `on_create`

-
## "Improving" our controller

- Let's modify the machine whenever it's updated
 (Also change the name of the function)
```python
@kopf.on.create('machines')
@kopf.on.update('machines')
def create_update_fn(spec, name, namespace, logger, **kwargs):
```


---

## Set machine status

All handlers can return arbitrary JSON-serializable values. 

These values are then written  to the resource status under the name of the handler.

Let's set machine status to flipped:

```python
#add this in the beginning
from datetime import datetime
#and add this in the end of create_update_fn
return {'flipped at': datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') }
```

---

## What's the status?

.exercise[
Patch the machine and get its status:
```
kubectl patch machine machine-1 --type=merge -p "
spec:
  SwitchPosition: up
"
kubectl get machine machine-1 -ojsonpath="{ .status }"
```
]
